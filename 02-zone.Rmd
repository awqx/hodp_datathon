knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = F)
```

```{r}
prop <- read.csv("data/gisid.csv")
```

Because some data points do not have zoning designations, we will create a new factor `"Z"` to prevent errors when running models later.

```{r}
prop_zone <- prop %>%
  mutate(zoning = as.character(zoning)) %>%
  mutate(
    zoning = ifelse(is.na(zoning) | zoning == "", "Z", zoning)
)
```

Additionally, we will remove data examples where the GISID is not available or does not exist. 

```{r}
prop_zone <- prop_zone %>% 
  filter(gisid != "")
```

We will rewrite the file to save it. 

```{r}
write.csv(prop_zone, "data/zone.csv", row.names = F)
```
